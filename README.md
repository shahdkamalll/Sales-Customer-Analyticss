# Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboard

##  Overview
This is an end-to-end **Data Analytics Project** where I worked on customer, sales, and product data.  
The project covers the full cycle: **data cleaning & preprocessing (Python & SQL)**, **analysis**, and **visualization using Power BI**.

The final output is a **4-page interactive Power BI dashboard** that provides actionable business insights.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy for data cleaning & analysis)  
- **SQL** (data exploration & preparation)  
- **Power BI** (dashboard design & visualization)

---

##  Dashboard Pages
1. **Sales** – revenue trends, orders, channel performance  
2. **Customers** – active vs inactive, demographics  
3. **Customer Segmentation** – RFM & spending behavior  
4. **Products** – profit, quantity sold, top products  

---

##  Key Insights
- **42% of customers are inactive**.  
- **All orders happened only in Q2**, while Q1, Q3, and Q4 had only logins without purchases → strong engagement but no conversions.  
- **Average spend per customer ≈ 559**.  
- **France and Germany** have the largest customer base but also higher inactivity → potential churn risk.  
- **Top 5 customers** contribute a significant portion of total revenue (Pareto effect).  
- **Sales peak in March & April**, while the last quarter shows a drop.  
- A small set of products generate most of the **profit & sales volume** → inventory optimization opportunity.  
- **E-commerce slightly outperforms Mobile App** in sales volume.  
- Only ~9% of products are discounted, yet **non-discounted items drive the majority of revenue**.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to transform **raw messy data** into **clear business insights** using Python, SQL, and Power BI.  
It also highlights the value of combining **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** to tell the story behind the numbers.
